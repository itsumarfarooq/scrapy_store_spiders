Hi Jimmy,

I'm pleased to inform you that I've completed the Sam's Club web scraper project as requested. I'm sending you the following for your review:

1. JSON data extracted by the scraper
2. Project code (as a zip file)

The main file to review is `scrapy_store_scrapers\spiders\samsclub.py`. This file contains the core functionality of the scraper.

Notable features and challenges:
1. Implemented efficient data extraction using Scrapy's asynchronous capabilities.
2. Handled complex JSON parsing from embedded script tags.
3. Implemented robust error handling and logging for better maintainability.
4. Formatted data (e.g., phone numbers, addresses, hours) for consistency and readability.
5. Extracted additional services information from the club pages.

To run the scraper:
1. Navigate to the project directory
2. Run `scrapy crawl samsclub`

I'd appreciate your feedback on the implementation, particularly regarding code structure and efficiency. If you need any changes or have additional requirements, please let me know.

Thank you for your time. I'm looking forward to your review and any further instructions you might have.

Best regards,
Umar Farooq

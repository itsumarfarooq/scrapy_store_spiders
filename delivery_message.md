Hi Jimmy,

I hope this message finds you well. I've completed the SamsClub scraper implementation task. I'm sending you the following for your review:

1. JSON data
2. Project code (as a zip file)

Key points:

- The main file to review is `scrapy_store_scrapers\spiders\samsclub.py`.
- I've implemented all requested improvements, including better code structure, improved error handling, and more descriptive naming.
- The scraper now follows senior-level best practices, enhancing maintainability and readability.
- I've thoroughly tested the scraper to ensure it's functioning as expected.

Please pay special attention to the `samsclub.py` file. I'd appreciate your feedback on the overall structure and any areas you think could be further improved.

If you have any questions or need any clarification, please don't hesitate to ask. I'm available to discuss the implementation in more detail if needed.

Thank you for your time. I look forward to your review and any additional insights you might have.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

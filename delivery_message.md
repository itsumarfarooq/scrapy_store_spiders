Hi Jimmy,

I've finished the Sam's Club store scraper you asked for, and it's ready for your review. I'm excited to share the results with you!

Here are the key points:

Task Completed: Implemented a web scraper for Sam's Club store information
Main File: scrapy_store_scrapers\spiders\samsclub.py
Functionality: Scrapes store information from www.samsclub.com
    Extracts details like store name, address, phone, hours, and services
    Handles geolocation data for each store
Code Structure: Uses Scrapy framework
    Implements a two-step scraping process
    Includes robust error handling and logging
    Formats data consistently (e.g., phone numbers, addresses)

I've attached the JSON data file with the scraped information and a ZIP file containing the project code. When you're reviewing, please focus on the main spider file (samsclub.py) as it contains the core implementation.

I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts and any suggestions you might have. Your feedback is always valuable!

P.S. The ZIP file includes all the necessary code and configuration files to run the scraper. Let me know if you need any help setting it up or have any questions about the implementation.

Hi Jimmy,

I'm excited to let you know that I've completed the Sam's Club store scraper you requested. It's now ready for your review, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts on it.

Here are the key points:

1. Task Completed: Implemented a web scraper for Sam's Club store information
2. Main File: `scrapy_store_scrapers\spiders\samsclub.py`
3. Functionality:
   o Scrapes store information from www.samsclub.com
   o Extracts details like store name, address, phone, hours, services, and geolocation data
   o Handles both the club finder page and individual club pages
4. Code Structure:
   o Uses Scrapy framework
   o Main class `SamsclubSpider` with methods like `parse`, `parse_club`, and `extract_club_data`
   o Extracts data using XPath and JSON parsing
   o Includes error handling for JSON parsing and logging for potential issues

I've attached the JSON data file with the scraped information and a ZIP file containing the project code. When you're reviewing, please focus on the main spider file `samsclub.py` as it contains the core implementation.

I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts and any suggestions you might have. Your feedback is always valuable!

P.S. The ZIP file includes all the necessary code and configuration files to run the scraper. Let me know if you need any help setting it up or have any questions about the implementation.

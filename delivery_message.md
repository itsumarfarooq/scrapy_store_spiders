Hello team,

I've completed the task of implementing the SamsClub scraper and making the requested improvements. I'm sending the project code as a zip file for your review.

Key points about the implementation:

1. The main scraper file is `scrapy_store_scrapers\spiders\samsclub.py`.
2. I've implemented all the suggested improvements, including:
   - Better code structure and organization
   - Improved error handling and logging
   - Use of constants for repeated values
   - More descriptive variable names
   - Type hints for better code readability
   - Docstrings for classes and methods
   - Splitting large methods into smaller, more focused ones

3. The scraper now follows best practices for a senior-level implementation, making it more maintainable and easier to understand.

4. I've tested the scraper to ensure it's working as expected.

Please review the code, particularly the `samsclub.py` file, and let me know if you have any questions or if there are any further improvements you'd like me to make.

Thank you for your time, and I look forward to your feedback!

Best regards,
[Your Name]

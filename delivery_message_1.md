Hi Jimmy,

I'm pleased to inform you that the CVS store scraper has been successfully implemented and is now ready for your review. The scraper has been developed according to the specifications provided in the task document.

Here are the key points:

1. **Task Completed**: Implemented a scraper for CVS store locations using their API, processing multiple zip codes and deduplicating store results.

2. **Main File**: The core implementation can be found in `scrapy_store_scrapers\spiders\cvs.py`

3. **Functionality**:
   - Scrapes store data from CVS's API endpoint
   - Extracts comprehensive store information including address, store details, hours, and available services
   - Handles pagination to ensure all stores for a given zip code are captured

4. **Code Structure**:
   - Built using the Scrapy framework
   - Main class `CvsSpider` with methods `start_requests`, `parse`, and `get_headers`
   - Utilizes JSON parsing for data extraction from API responses
   - Implements error handling for JSON parsing and logging for important events

I've attached the `cvs.py` file for your review. To test the scraper, you can run it using the Scrapy command line interface. The scraper reads zip codes from a `zipcodes.json` file, so make sure this file is present in the project directory.

I look forward to your feedback on the implementation. Please let me know if you need any clarifications or if there are any adjustments you'd like me to make.

P.S. The ZIP file contains the main spider file (`cvs.py`), a sample of the JSON output (`cvs_sample.json`), and the task description (`task.txt`).
